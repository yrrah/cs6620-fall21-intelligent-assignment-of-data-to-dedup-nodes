This directory is for building a docker image with all dependencies 
required for back_end. That image will be used as the base-image for 
building our source code so that builds go faster during development. 

Docker registry location of a compiled image is:
`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/cs6620-fall21-intelligentassignment-dedupnodes/cs6620-fall21-dedup-nodes-back-end-dependencies:latest`
