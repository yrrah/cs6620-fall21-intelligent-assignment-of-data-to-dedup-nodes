> TODO show in a very small amount of space the **MOST** useful thing your package can do.
Make it as short as possible! You have an entire set of docs for later.

### Command Line Interface

The front_end command line tool is automatically installed. It can

```shell
$ front_end --help
```

> TODO show the most useful thing the CLI does! The CLI will have documentation auto-generated
by `sphinx`.
